# Work_Day_Scheduler
___
## Objective
Create a daily planner to manage time effectively by posting hourly events and/or tasks into assigned timeblocks.  The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.  Timeblocks in the form of rows are assigned for standard business hours (9AM to 5PM).  When viewing timeblocks for the current day, each block is color coded to indicate whether that specific block is in the past, present, or future.  When the user clicks on a timeblock, they are able to enter an event or task associated with that time period.  They can save the information by pressing the corresponding save button for that timeblock.  The information is then saved into local storage.
